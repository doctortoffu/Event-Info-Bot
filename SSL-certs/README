Instructions
------------

Store your SSL server certificates and private keys in this folder. These are required to enable webhooks in the
Telegram bot, so if you are only going to use the Twitter bot then you can skip this step. I recommend that you use the
same file names already set in /bot/app/config.py so that you don't need to change those setting there.

Remember that both the certificates and keys should be in PEM format! At least that's the format required to deploy them
to Google App Engine and for setting a webhook with Telegram servers. If your server uses Apache or other web server
check its documentation for the best file option.

Also remember to check the Telegram API documentation if you intend to use self-signed certificates. There you will
find a handy guide that will help you avoid common problems when implementing this kind of certificates. You can find
that guide at https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks
